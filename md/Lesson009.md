#### The parametric form

\<Side by side comparison of the two different kinds of parametrization>

What did you notice about the two different parametrizations?

Did you notice anything different about the speed at which the particle moves?

How about the distance that the particle moves?

What did you notice about the shape of the x and y graphs?

What about the range of parameter values?

What about the shape of the resulting circle?  Did you notice anything missing from one of the circles? 

Having introduced you to the idea of parametrization, and demonstrated some of the interesting differences in the behaviors of different parametrizations, we're going to back up for a minute to some more simple geometries.
