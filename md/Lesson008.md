#### The parametric form

Remember the alternate parametrization of our circle involving the rational polynomials $x=\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}$ and $y=\frac{2t}{1+t^2}$?

ASSIGNMENT: In this assignment, I want you to draw a similar set of graphs, but this time involving the rational polynomials for x and y.  Obviously the two graphs on the right (for x and y) are going to look rather different than the sine and cosine illustrated below, but you will discover some really interesting things in the process of designing this.

As with the assignment where the circle was parametrized using sine and cosine, by default, the Animate checkbox is unchecked, and you may use the scale control to move the position of the "particle" around the circle and graphs.  Notice that the equations and numeric coordinates all update in real-time.

If the Animate checkbox is checked, the graphs will all update in real-time, matching the motion of the particle around the circle.  When the Animate checkbox is checked, the scale control is disabled.

Note: You should use jlatexmath to render the equations as bitmaps.
