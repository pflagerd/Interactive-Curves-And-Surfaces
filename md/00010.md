#### The Function

In mathematics, most of us learn about functions starting with 2D functions in x and y.



Most of us are familiar with graphs of such functions looking something like this:

The idea is that you vary x through its ***[domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function)***, and you sweep out y in its ***[codomain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codomain)***.  In older language, co-domain is also known as ***[range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(mathematics))***.  In some texts, it is called the ***[image***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_(mathematics)) or ***target-set***. Throughout this project, we'll use the term co-domain.

Q: Assuming the graph shown extends to y = $\infty$ on the left, and y = -$\infty$ on the right, what kind of polynomial is this?

Q: Using SWT, create an exact replica of the graph shown above, including the text labels.
