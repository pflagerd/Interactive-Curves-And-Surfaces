<h1>The Function</h1>
In mathematics and engineering we often use equations like $y = 3x + 4$.

<p>If you read the equation aloud, you say "y equals 3 (times) x plus 4."</p>

<p>Notice that "equals" and "equation" have the same stem-word "equa", from the latin word which means "identical".</p>

<p>Notice that the word "times" is optional.</p>

<p>When we use an equation to compute something, we often refer to the equation as a formula.</p>

<p>What "formula" means is a procedure whereby you substitute a value for $x$ into the equation, and the use the equation to compute a corresponding value of $y$.</p>

<p>For example, if you substitute the value $5$ for $x$, you get a corresponding $y$ value of $3\times5 + 4$.</p>

<p>Since $3\times 5 + 4 = 19$, we can say that for $x$ = $5$, the formula yields $y$ = 19.</p>

<p>Obviously, computers are very good at computing values from formulas.</p>

<p>Observe that in the given equation, for any single value of $x$ (where $x$ is a real number), there is a corresponding single value of $y$ (where $y$ is also a real number).</p>

<p>When an equation has the property that for any single value of $x$ there is a corresponding single value of $y$, we say that the equation represents a <b><i>function</i></b>.</p>

<p>In such a case, we may write $f(x) = 3x+4$ instead of $y = 3x + 4$</p>

<p>If you read this function aloud, you say "f of x equals 3 (times) x plus 4.</p>

<p>Here, "f of x" is an abbreviation of "function of x".</p>

<p>Most computer programming languages also have language features that they call functions, but it's important that computer language functions are not always equivalent to mathematical functions.</p>

<p>only when they have the same properties as mathematical functions, are computer language functions equivalent to mathematical functions.</p>

<p>Because they are very good at computing values from formulas, and because they have graphics capabilities, computers are very good at drawing <b><i>graphs</i></b> of functions.</p>

<p>Drawing the graph of $y = 3x + 4$ involves computing $y$ for a great many values of $x$, and then drawing the results - often as a great many points - on the computer's screen.</p>

<p>ASSIGNMENT: Your assignment is to draw a graph similar to this one, using JGlut. The graph shall consist of 1024 points, and should reach from one side of the window to the other. It should resize correctly. </p>
