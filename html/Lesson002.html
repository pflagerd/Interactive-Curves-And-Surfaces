<h1>Coordinate Systems</h1>
You may have recognized that our origin equation, $y = 3x + 4$, is the equation of a line.

<p>Perhaps you also noticed that it has the form $y = mx + c$</p>

<p>You may have also already know that the equation $y = mx + c$ is often called <b><i>the slope-intercept form </i></b>of the equation of a line.</p>

<p>You may also know that to represent a line as graph usually involves a coordinate system.</p>

<p>The coordinate system shows you which way positive values of $x$ increase, and which way positive values of $y$ increase.</p>

<p>They also show where the starting value of $x$ and the starting value of $y$ is located.</p>

<p>The starting value of $x$ is usually 0 and $y$ is usually 0, and is called the <b><i>origin</i></b>.</p>

<p>They usually also indicate how to measure distance along $x$ and $y$. Little perpendicular line segments are drawn associated with some number and unit.</p>

<p>This makes it possible to draw a point on the graph by referring to its location as a pair of numbers, one for the x location of the point, and one for the y location of the point.</p>

<p>Such pairs of numbers are usually written like this: $(x, y)$</p>

<p>ASSIGNMENT: Your assignment is to add a coordinate system to your line graph, using JGlut, similar to the one shown.</p>

<p>The coordinate system shall be centered in the window, and shall scale at the same rate both horizontally and vertically.</p>

<p>The coordinate system shall indicate its horizontal and vertical scale, which shall be identical, both with little perpendicular line segments, and with numeric values</p>
